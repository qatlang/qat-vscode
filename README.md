Basic analysis for the language is supported. It now displays errors and warnings. Only 1 error per file is supported, since analysis stops at the first encounter of an error. Multiple warnings will be displayed across various files if there are warnings.

The extension does not have to updated to get new error messages and warnings added to the compiler. The extension is not dependant on a specific version of the compiler. You can update the compiler to get the latest iteration of analysis support.

Here is a list of features supported:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Error and warning analysis
